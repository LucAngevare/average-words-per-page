Many websites state that a good rule of thumb is that 500 words make an A4 page, however, my experience said that this number was more around the 400 words. This made me interested enough to program a simulation to test the biggest repository of English words (which consists of more words than the Oxford English Dictionary) to see how many words would fit on the average A4 page. This paper aims to find the true number of words a page can fit, so students have a true answer on about how many words they would need to write to fit the assigned amount of words. This can be an important and convenient statistic for preparing for an oral exam or research paper, when a teacher assigns one of these with a word count, students know about how many pages would correspond to that.
  
## Findings

Various literary works and sources state that on average 500 words fill an A4 page, this study however, has shown a different outcome. Instead of finding 500 words per average page, this study claims to find 392 words on average. The amount of characters found per page was closer to the amount the sources had stated. This amount was close to 3600 characters, as opposed to the amount of 3000 according to the cited sources. This means that per usable cm<sup>2</sup> 1.12 words could be expected, and 10.29 characters. This, in turn, meant that on average every word in the English alphabet consists of on average 9.18, providing a stark contrast to the 4 characters that various sources provide.
